First steps with GIT, making a project with Rocketseat

  Hey, hello there! This is a website project developed by Rocketseat (and by me as a learner :) ). Feel free to contribute
and to suggest improvements.
It is mainly composed by JavaScript (and its framework Node.js), HTML/CSS (using also nunjucks) and a little bit of SQL.
