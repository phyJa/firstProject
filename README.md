First steps with GIT, making a project with Rocketseat

   Hey, hello there! This is a website project developed by Rocketseat (and by me as a learner :) ). The goal of this application is to
  register and list places where recycling is done.
  Feel free to contribute!
  It is mainly composed by JavaScript (and its framework Node.js), HTML/CSS (using also nunjucks) and a little bit of SQL.
  
  Note: all the comments of the project are in Portuguese.
