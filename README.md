First steps with GIT, making a project with Rocketseat

## Getting Started

Hey, hello there! This is a website project developed by Rocketseat (and by me as a learner :) ). The goal of this application is to
register and list places where recycling is done.
Feel free to contribute!

### Prerequisites

Here we list the tools and other softwares you must have or install to execute the project.
```
* Node.js
* Nunjucks (as the template engine)
* SQLite (or other Relational Database Management System, such as MySQL)
```
